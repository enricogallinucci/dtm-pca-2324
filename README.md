2. Open a terminal (```Anaconda prompt``` if you are on Windows)
3. Run the following commands:
    - ```conda install -y -c conda-forge ipycanvas```

1. Download the content of this repository using git (```git clone https://github.com/enricogallinucci/dtm-pca-2324.git```) or just download the ZIP and unzip the content
    - Note that the repository will be updated throughout the course, e.g., to upload new exercises and solutions
2. Open a terminal (look for the "Anaconda prompt" program if you are on Windows)
3. Change the current folder to your working folder (where you have copied the exercise files)
    - ```cd C:/path_to_the_folder_with_exercises```
4. Run the following command:
    - ```jupyter lab```

## Questionnaires

At the end of each lab, please take 20 seconds to fill a very brief (and anonymous) questionnaire - it will help me in understanding how the classroom is going, refining the exercises in the following labs, and improving next year's edition.
